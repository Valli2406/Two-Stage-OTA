# Two-Stage-OTA
Designed and simulated a two-stage OTA using TSMC 180nm CMOS technology, meeting a minimum DC gain requirement of 40â€¯dB. The project involved hand calculations for transistor sizing and bias point estimation, followed by LTSpice simulation for DC and transient analysis. The OTA was integrated into a non-inverting amplifier configuration to verify closed-loop performance and ensure design accuracy under realistic operating conditions.
